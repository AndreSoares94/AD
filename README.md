# Análise de Dados - Desenvolvimento de um sistema de Data Warehousing e de um sistema de Business Intelligence para suporte à decisão
University Project for Data Analysis - course of Computer Engineering at University of Minho.

## So, what is this?
This project had the objective of creating a Data Warehousing system and use Business Intelligence to help create a decision-support system. The chosen dataset is [European Football Market Values](https://www.kaggle.com/aricht1995/european-football-market-values) which defere to the market value info and other data on football players from the top 9 European leagues. After an ETL fase where we treated, extracted, transformed and loaded the data to a relational database in MySQL Workbench, we moved to the next phase in Business Intelligence using Microsoft PowerBI Desktop to create a decision-support system.
